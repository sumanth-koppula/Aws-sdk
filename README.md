# Aws-sdk

The aws-sdk is the official SDK (Software Development Kit) provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for interacting with various AWS services using JavaScript in Node.js or in web browsers. It allows developers to integrate and work with AWS services, such as Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), and many others, directly from their JavaScript applications.
